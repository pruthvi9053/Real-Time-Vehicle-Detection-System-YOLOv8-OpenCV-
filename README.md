# Real-Time-Vehicle-Detection-System-YOLOv8-OpenCV-
This project is a real-time Vehicle Detection System built using YOLOv8 and OpenCV, designed to detect and count different vehicle types from traffic video footage.

It highlights the ability to detect only specific vehicle classes, draw colored bounding boxes, calculate FPS, and display vehicle counts live on screen — making it suitable for smart traffic, surveillance, and analytics use cases.

✅ Features
Feature	Description:-
Vehicle Detection-	Detects Car, Motorcycle, Bus, Truck only
Colored Bounding Boxes-	Different color for each vehicle type
Vehicle Counting-	Counts number of each type per frame
Real-Time FPS Display-	Shows model performance (Frames Per Second)
Confidence Score-	Shows probability on each box.

✅Library / Tool	Use :-
Python 3.x-	Main programming language
YOLOv8 (Ultralytics)-	Object detection model
OpenCV-	Video processing & display
NumPy- Frame manipulation, backend support
